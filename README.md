### Dumb contracts

Blockchain contracts are a way to create a decentralized application (dapp) on the blockchain. The contract is a piece of code that is stored on the blockchain and can be executed by anyone. The contract is executed by the blockchain nodes and the result is stored on the blockchain. The contract can be executed by anyone, but only the contract owner can change the contract code. The contract owner is the address that created the contract. The contract owner can change the contract code by sending a transaction to the contract address.
