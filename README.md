### 'Dumb Contracts' explained as Donald Trump

Look, folks, let me tell you about dumb contracts. They're not smart, they're not good, believe me. They're just like the deals made by sleepy Joe, terrible. They rely on humans, who knows what kind of mistakes they could make. And let me tell you, mistakes are bad, very bad.

Smart contracts, on the other hand, they're tremendous. They're the best contracts, believe me. They're automatic, they don't need anyone to tell them what to do, they just do it. They're like a beautiful, perfect robot, you know? They're just fantastic.

So, if you want to make deals like a winner, you gotta go with smart contracts, folks. They're the best, the greatest, the most amazing contracts you've ever seen. No one does contracts better than me, trust me.
